Bug Track is a web application to help assist in tracking the progression of a software project. Users can create a team and a unique pin that can be shared to team members so they can join the same team. Then roles can be assigned to different team members and the progression tracking begins. Progression is tracked mainly through tickets, which have a variety of attributes. Each ticket even has the option for adding comments and files to add more detail.

Web Application was created using Django webframework.

External tools: PostgreSQL and AWS S3 Buckets
